# SMT-Based-Variability-Analyses-for-FeatureIDE
Contains all empirically evaluated models and results for the paper SMT-Based Variability Analyses in FeatureIDE. Void Explanations were not measures as none of the models were void.

## Models

All used model can be found at [FeatureIDE](https://github.com/FeatureIDE/FeatureIDE):

### Models for the FM Anaylses

All models for the feature model analyses can be found [here](https://github.com/FeatureIDE/FeatureIDE/tree/develop/plugins/de.ovgu.featureide.examples/featureide_examples/FeatureModels). All models from `XSEngine` to `vrc4375`.

### Models for the Configuration Analyses

`automotive` model used for the configuration analyses can be found [here](https://github.com/FeatureIDE/FeatureIDE/tree/develop/plugins/de.ovgu.featureide.examples/featureide_examples/FeatureModels). The model is named `Automotive02_V4`.

### Models for the Preprocessor Analyses

The first antenna preprocessor example project for the preprocessor analyses can be found [here](https://github.com/FeatureIDE/FeatureIDE/tree/develop/plugins/de.ovgu.featureide.examples/featureide_examples/TankWar-Antenna) and the second example project can be found [here](https://github.com/FeatureIDE/FeatureIDE/tree/develop/plugins/de.ovgu.featureide.examples/featureide_examples/Book/OOP/Elevator).

### Models for the Attribute Range Computation

All the models for attribute range analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/FeatureIDE/FeatureIDE/tree/develop/plugins/de.ovgu.featureide.examples/featureide_examples/ExtendedFeatureModeling).
